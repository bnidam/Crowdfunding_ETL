# Crowdfunding_ETL

## Project Overview
This project explores the process of ETL - extracting, transforming, and loading data, starting with a large Excel file of Crowdfunding campaign data. The following process was followed:
- Extracting and transforming the data from the large Excel file into four separate CSV files
- Creating a PostgreSQL database and tables by using an ERD
- Loading the CSV files into the database
- Performing SQL queries to generate reports for stakeholders

## Tools used for this project
The tools used for this project include Python and jupyter notebook: pandas, QuickDBD for ERDs, PgAdmin for PostgreSQL.

## Summary
This Challenge was... challenging, yet very satisfying in that it built upon skills learned in this module and in prior modules, while also being close to a real life application. It was easy to see that someone could actually request this information, and this is the process that a data analyst would use to import, sort, clean, transform the data itself, then scope out the data table relationships, and conduct a variety of queries to produce data tables/reports that could be used in real life.
